    <h1>LibRaw Compilation and Installation</h1>
    <p>LibRaw is distributed in the form of source codes. For further use, they
      should be compiled (and, if desired, placed into system folders with
      libraries and include-files).</p>
    <a name="unix"></a>
    <h2>Unix Systems (FreeBSD, Linux, Mac OS X)</h2>
    <p> To build the library, you will need a working C++ compiler (gcc 3+ and
      clang 2+ are OK) and the make utility. </p>
    <p>Additional libraries (optional):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>zlib (used to decode deflated DNGs)</li>
      <li>libjasper (used to decode RED files)</li>
      <li>libjpeg8 (used to decode lossy DNGs and several old Kodak cameras)</li>
    </ul>
    <p> LibRaw has been tested on 32- and 64-bit Unix systems working on x86-
      (and AMD64-) compatible processors. Building and work on other
      architectures have not been tested. </p>
    <h3>Compilation of Library and Examples</h3>
    <p> Unpack the downloaded distribution package.</p>
    <pre>        tar xzvf LibRaw-X.YY.tar.gz
</pre>
    <p>For GitHub downloads (clones), perform ./configure script generation via</p>
    <pre>        autoreconf --install</pre>
    <p>Go to LibRaw directory and run <b>./configure</b> and <b>make</b>: </p>
    <pre>cd LibRaw-X.YY
./configure # with optional args
make
    </pre>
    <p>As a result, you will compile</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Library libraw.a in the lib/ folder</li>
      <li><a href="Samples-LibRaw.html">Examples</a> in the bin/ folder (source
        codes of examples are in the samples/ folder).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the current version, only static libraries are built:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>libraw.a: non-thread-safe version</li>
      <li>libraw_r.a: thread-safe</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Build parameters</h3>
    <p> ./configure script have some non-standard parameters: </p>
    <dl>
      <dt> --enable-openmp<br>
        --disable-openmp </dt>
      <dd> Enable/disable OpenMP support if compiler supports it. OpenMP is
        enabled by default. </dd>
      <dt> --enable-lcms<br>
        --disable-lcms </dt>
      <dd> Enable/disable LCMS color engine support. If enabled, ./configure
        will try to find lcms library. Both LCMS-1.x and LCMS-2.x are supported
        LCMS support is enabled by default </dd>
      <dt> --enable-examples<br>
        --disable-examples </dt>
      <dd> Enables/disables examples compilation and installation. Enabled by
        default </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Installation and Usage</h3>
    <p>To install the library, run</p>
    <pre>    sudo make install
    </pre>
    <p> It will place the libraries in <b>/usr/local/lib</b>, the include-files
      in <b>/usr/local/include</b> (subfolder of libraw) and LibRaw samples to
      <b>/usr/local/bin</b>. You can override installation path by using
      ./configure script. <br>
      To use LibRaw, add the following parameters to the compiler call (when
      building your own projects): </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Path to include-files: -I/usr/local/include</li>
      <li>Path to libraries: -L/usr/local/lib</li>
      <li>Library: -lraw (ordinary version) or -lraw_r (thread-safe version).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Windows: Building under Cygwin</h2>
    <p> Building and installation are completely similar to <a href="#unix">building
        and installation under Unix systems</a>. </p>
    <h2>Windows: Native Building</h2>
    <p> Building under Windows has three steps: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unpack the distribution package (if you have got no tar+gzip, take the
        LibRaw distribution package in the .ZIP format) and go to folder
        LibRaw-X.YYY. </li>
      <li>Set the environment parameters so that the compiler/linker would find
        the libraries and include-files. For Visual C++, this is done by running
        <b>vcvars32.bat</b>. </li>
      <li> Run<br>
        <b>nmake -f Makefile.msvc</b><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may need to edit Makefile.msvc to provide libjpeg/zlib/libjasper
      paths to INCLUDE/LIB.</p>
    <p> If all paths are set correctly and the include-files/libraries have been
      found, then the following will be compiled:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Library libraw_static.lib in folder lib</li>
      <li>Dynamic library bin/libraw.dll and linking library for it
        lib/libraw.lib</li>
      <li>Examples in folder bin/.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Only the thread-safe library is built under Win32, but it can be used
      with non-threaded applications as well. All examples are linked with the
      dynamic library (DLL); if static linking is necessary, one should link
      applications with library libraw_static.lib and set the preprocessor
      option /DLIBRAW_NODLL during compilation. </p>
    <p> Windows-version compiles without LCMS support for now. </p>
    <p> During building of DLL, all public functions are exported; further, the
      exported subset may be reduced. </p>
    <p> Unfortunately, paths to include/ libraries depend on the way Visual C
      (or other compiler) is installed; therefore, it is impossible to specify
      some standard paths in Makefile.msvc. </p>
    <h2>Windows Installation</h2>
    <p> No installation under Windows is supported. It is assumed that all DLLs
      will be supplied together with the software using them (and this software
      will perform the installation). Accordingly, in building of programs using
      LibRaw, the paths to libraries, DLLs, and include-files should be
      specified manually. </p>

Due to inability to support (user contributed) Cmake scripts,
the cmake builds are not officially supported by LibRaw team
since October 23, 2014

The scripts are moved to separate github repository
github.com:LibRaw/LibRaw-cmake.git

Checkout from this repo if you want to use Cmake to build LibRaw.

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_OPENMP([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro tries to find out how to compile programs that use OpenMP a
#   standard API and set of compiler directives for parallel programming
#   (see http://www-unix.mcs/)
#
#   On success, it sets the OPENMP_CFLAGS/OPENMP_CXXFLAGS/OPENMP_F77FLAGS
#   output variable to the flag (e.g. -omp) used both to compile *and* link
#   OpenMP programs in the current language.
#
#   NOTE: You are assumed to not only compile your program with these flags,
#   but also link it with them as well.
#
#   If you want to compile everything with OpenMP, you should set:
#
#     CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $OPENMP_CFLAGS"
#     #OR#  CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS $OPENMP_CXXFLAGS"
#     #OR#  FFLAGS="$FFLAGS $OPENMP_FFLAGS"
#
#   (depending on the selected language).
#
#   The user can override the default choice by setting the corresponding
#   environment variable (e.g. OPENMP_CFLAGS).
#
#   ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if an OpenMP flag is
#   found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it is
#   not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action will
#   define HAVE_OPENMP.

======================= LibRaw demosaic pack(s) ===============================

We were forced to stop supporting LibRaw demosaic packs: the contributed code
is out of date for several years, initial contributors has no interest in it.

We too: we (LibRaw team) focused on RAW decode and metadata extraction, but not
on postprocessing (demosaic, noise suppression, etc).

So, LibRaw-demosaic-pack-GPLn are abandoned now. We will be happy to convey 
their support and development to any developer who will show interest.

LibRaw 0.19 contains callback calls placed instead of calls to demosaic pack routines.
So, adaptation of demosaic packs to new LibRaw should be easy (and, of course, we'll
provide some support and/or implement additional callbacks if needed).

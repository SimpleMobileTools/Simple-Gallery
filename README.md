A gallery for viewing photos and videos.

A highly customizable gallery capable of displaying many different image and video types including SVGs, RAWs, panoramic photos and videos.

It is open source, contains no ads or unnecessary permissions.

Let's list some of its features worth mentioning:
1. Search
2. Slideshow
3. Notch support
4. Pinning folders to the top
5. Filtering media files by type
6. Recycle bin for easy file recovery
7. Fullscreen view orientation locking
8. Marking favorite files for easy access
9. Quick fullscreen media closing with down gesture
10. An editor for modifying images and applying filters
11. Password protection for protecting hidden items or the whole app
12. Changing the thumbnail column count with gestures or menu buttons
13. Customizable bottom actions at the fullscreen view for quick access
14. Showing extended details over fullscreen media with desired file properties
15. Several different ways of sorting or grouping items, both ascending and descending
16. Hiding folders (affects other apps too), excluding folders (affects only Simple Gallery)

The fingerprint permission is needed for locking either hidden item visibility, the whole app, or protecting files from being deleted.

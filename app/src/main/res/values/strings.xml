    <!-- Short description has to have less than 80 chars -->
    <string name="app_short_description">A gallery for viewing photos and videos without ads.</string>
    <string name="app_long_description">
        A simple tool usable for viewing photos and videos. Items can be sorted by date, size, name both ascending or descending, photos can be zoomed in. Media files are shown in multiple columns depending on the size of the display, you can change the column count by pinch gestures. They can be renamed, shared, deleted, copied, moved. Images can also be cropped, rotated or set as Wallpaper directly from the app.


        The Gallery is also offered for third party usage for previewing images / videos, adding attachments at email clients etc. It\'s perfect for everyday usage.

        Contains no ads or unnecessary permissions. It is fully opensource, provides a Dark theme too.

        This app is just one piece of a bigger series of apps. You can find the rest of them at http://www.simplemobiletools.com

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <string name="faq_1_title">How can I make Simple Gallery the default device gallery?</string>
    <string name="faq_1_text">First you have to find the currently default gallery in the Apps section of your device settings, look for a button that says something like \"Open by default\", click on it, then select \"Clear defaults\".
        The next time you will try opening an image or video you should see an app picker, where you can select Simple Gallery and make it the default app.</string>
    <string name="faq_2_title">I locked the app with a password, but I forgot it. What can I do?</string>
    <string name="faq_2_text">You can solve it in 2 ways. You can either reinstall the app, or find the app in your device settings and select \"Clear data\". It will reset all your settings, it will not remove any media files.</string>
    <string name="faq_3_title">How can I make an album always appear at the top?</string>
    <string name="faq_3_text">You can long press the desired album and select the Pin icon at the actionmenu, that will pin it to the top. You can pin multiple folders too, pinned items will be sorted by the default sorting method.</string>
    <string name="faq_4_title">How can I fast-forward videos?</string>
    <string name="faq_4_text">You can click on the current or max duration texts near the seekbar, that will move the video either backward, or forward.</string>
    <string name="faq_5_title">What is the difference between hiding and excluding a folder?</string>
    <string name="faq_5_text">Exclude prevents displaying the folder only in Simple Gallery, while Hide works system-wise and it hides the folder from other galleries too. It works by creating an empty \".nomedia\" file in the given folder, which you can then remove with any file manager too.</string>
    <string name="faq_6_title">Why do folders with music cover art or stickers show up?</string>
    <string name="faq_6_text">It can happen that you will see some unusual albums show up. You can easily exclude them by long pressing them and selecting Exclude. In the next dialog you can then select the parent folder, chances are it will prevent the other related albums showing up too.</string>
    <string name="faq_7_title">A folder with images isn\'t showing up, what can I do?</string>
    <string name="faq_7_text">That can have multiple reasons, but solving it is easy. Just go in Settings -> Manage Included Folders, select Plus and navigate to the required folder.</string>
    <string name="faq_8_title">What if I want just a few particular folders visible?</string>
    <string name="faq_8_text">Adding a folder at the Included Folders doesn\'t automatically exclude anything. What you can do is go in Settings -> Manage Excluded Folders, exclude the root folder \"/\", then add the desired folders at Settings -> Manage Included Folders.
        That will make only the selected folders visible, as both excluding and including are recursive and if a folder is both excluded and included, it will show up.</string>
    <string name="faq_9_title">Fullscreen images have weird artifacts, can I somehow improve the quality?</string>
    <string name="faq_9_text">Yea, there is a toggle in Settings saying \"Replace deep zoomable images with better quality ones\", you can use that. It will improve the quality of the images, but they will get blurred once you try zooming in too much.</string>
    <string name="faq_10_title">Can I crop images with this app?</string>
    <string name="faq_10_text">Yes, you can crop images in the editor, by dragging the image corners. You can get to the editor either by long pressing an image thumbnail and selecting Edit, or selecting Edit from the fullscreen view.</string>
    <string name="faq_11_title">Can I somehow group media file thumbnails?</string>
    <string name="faq_11_text">Sure, just use the \"Group by\" menu item while at the thumbnails view. You can group files by multiple criteria, including Date Taken. If you use the \"Show all folders content\" function you can group them by folders too.</string>
    <string name="faq_12_title">Sorting by Date Taken doesn\'t seem to work properly, how can I fix it?</string>
    <string name="faq_12_text">It is most likely caused by the files being copied from somewhere. You can fix it by selecting the file thumbnails and selecting \"Fix Date Taken value\".</string>
    <string name="faq_13_title">I see some color banding on the images. How can I improve the quality?</string>
    <string name="faq_13_text">The current solution for displaying images works fine in the vast majority of cases, but if you want even better image quality, you can enable the \"Show images in the highest possible quality\" at the app settings, in the \"Deep zoomable images\" section.</string>
    <string name="faq_14_title">I have hidden a file/folder. How can I unhide it?</string>
    <string name="faq_14_text">You can either press the \"Temporarily show hidden items\" menu item at the main screen, or toggle \"Show hidden items\" in the app settings to see the hidden item. If you want to unhide it, just long press it and select \"Unhide\". Folders are hidden by adding a hidden \".nomedia\" file into them, you can delete the file with any file manager too.</string>

    <string name="app_short_description">A gallery for viewing photos and videos without ads.</string>
    <string name="app_long_description">
        A highly customizable gallery capable of displaying many different image and video types including SVGs, RAWs, panoramic photos and videos.

        It is open source, contains no ads or unnecessary permissions.

        Let\'s list some of its features worth mentioning:
        1. Search
        2. Slideshow
        3. Notch support
        4. Pinning folders to the top
        5. Filtering media files by type
        6. Recycle bin for easy file recovery
        7. Fullscreen view orientation locking
        8. Marking favorite files for easy access
        9. Quick fullscreen media closing with down gesture
        10. An editor for modifying images and applying filters
        11. Password protection for protecting hidden items or the whole app
        12. Changing the thumbnail column count with gestures or menu buttons
        13. Customizable bottom actions at the fullscreen view for quick access
        14. Showing extended details over fullscreen media with desired file properties
        15. Several different ways of sorting or grouping items, both ascending and descending
        16. Hiding folders (affects other apps too), excluding folders (affects only Simple Gallery)

        The fingerprint permission is needed for locking either hidden item visibility, the whole app, or protecting files from being deleted.

        This app is just one piece of a bigger series of apps. You can find the rest of them at https://www.simplemobiletools.com

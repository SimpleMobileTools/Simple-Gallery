    <!-- FAQ -->
    <string name="faq_1_title">How can I make Simple Gallery the default device gallery?</string>
    <string name="faq_1_text">First you have to find the currently default gallery in the Apps section of your device settings, look for a button that says something like \"Open by default\", click on it, then select \"Clear defaults\".
        The next time you will try opening an image or video you should see an app picker, where you can select Simple Gallery and make it the default app.</string>
    <string name="faq_2_title">I locked the app with a password, but I forgot it. What can I do?</string>
    <string name="faq_2_text">You can solve it in 2 ways. You can either reinstall the app, or find the app in your device settings and select \"Clear data\". It will reset all your settings, it will not remove any media files.</string>
    <string name="faq_3_title">How can I make an album always appear at the top?</string>
    <string name="faq_3_text">You can long press the desired album and select the Pin icon at the actionmenu, that will pin it to the top. You can pin multiple folders too, pinned items will be sorted by the default sorting method.</string>
    <string name="faq_4_title">How can I fast-forward videos?</string>
    <string name="faq_4_text">You can click on the current or max duration texts near the seekbar, that will move the video either backward, or forward.</string>
    <string name="faq_5_title">What is the difference between hiding and excluding a folder?</string>
    <string name="faq_5_text">Exclude prevents displaying the folder only in Simple Gallery, while Hide works system-wise and it hides the folder from other galleries too. It works by creating an empty \".nomedia\" file in the given folder, which you can then remove with any file manager too.</string>
    <string name="faq_6_title">Why do folders with music cover art or stickers show up?</string>
    <string name="faq_6_text">It can happen that you will see some unusual albums show up. You can easily exclude them by long pressing them and selecting Exclude. In the next dialog you can then select the parent folder, chances are it will prevent the other related albums showing up too.</string>
    <string name="faq_7_title">A folder with images isn\'t showing up, what can I do?</string>
    <string name="faq_7_text">That can have multiple reasons, but solving it is easy. Just go in Settings -> Manage Included Folders, select Plus and navigate to the required folder.</string>
    <string name="faq_8_title">What if I want just a few particular folders visible?</string>
    <string name="faq_8_text">Adding a folder at the Included Folders doesn\'t automatically exclude anything. What you can do is go in Settings -> Manage Excluded Folders, exclude the root folder \"/\", then add the desired folders at Settings -> Manage Included Folders.
        That will make only the selected folders visible, as both excluding and including are recursive and if a folder is both excluded and included, it will show up.</string>
    <string name="faq_9_title">Fullscreen images have weird artifacts, can I somehow improve the quality?</string>
    <string name="faq_9_text">Yea, there is a toggle in Settings saying \"Replace deep zoomable images with better quality ones\", you can use that. It will improve the quality of the images, but they will get blurred once you try zooming in too much.</string>
    <string name="faq_10_title">Can I crop images with this app?</string>
    <string name="faq_10_text">Yes, you can crop images in the editor, by dragging the image corners. You can get to the editor either by long pressing an image thumbnail and selecting Edit, or selecting Edit from the fullscreen view.</string>
    <string name="faq_11_title">Can I somehow group media file thumbnails?</string>
    <string name="faq_11_text">Sure, just use the \"Group by\" menu item while at the thumbnails view. You can group files by multiple criteria, including Date Taken. If you use the \"Show all folders content\" function you can group them by folders too.</string>
    <string name="faq_12_title">Sorting by Date Taken doesn\'t seem to work properly, how can I fix it?</string>
    <string name="faq_12_text">It is most likely caused by the files being copied from somewhere. You can fix it by selecting the file thumbnails and selecting \"Fix Date Taken value\".</string>

    <string name="app_short_description">Şəkil və videolara baxmaq üçün reklamsız qalereya.</string>
    <string name="app_long_description">
        A simple tool usable for viewing photos and videos. Items can be sorted by date, size, name both ascending or descending, photos can be zoomed in. Media files are shown in multiple columns depending on the size of the display, you can change the column count by pinch gestures. They can be renamed, shared, deleted, copied, moved. Images can also be cropped, rotated, flipped or set as Wallpaper directly from the app.

        The Gallery is also offered for third party usage for previewing images / videos, adding attachments at email clients etc. It\'s perfect for everyday usage.

        The fingerprint permission is needed for locking either hidden item visibility, or the whole app.

        Contains no ads or unnecessary permissions. It is fully opensource, provides customizable colors.

        This app is just one piece of a bigger series of apps. You can find the rest of them at https://www.simplemobiletools.com
